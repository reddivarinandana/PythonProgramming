<h3>****Why**** </h3>

<p>In India, every year, a staggering 8 lakh students graduate from engineering, with around 40 lakhs joining computer science programs hoping to pursue a career in the field. However, only 6% of them manage to secure placements in software companies. The primary issue lies in the lack of programming skills among the majority of these aspiring professionals.

We believe that if programming skills can be taught from a young age and in the native language of the students, we can bridge this gap and empower more individuals to thrive in the world of computer science. While there are several websites providing knowledge, there are few that combine knowledge with skill development, and most are in English.

SHecodes stands out as a web platform that caters specifically to Telugu-speaking students. Our mission is to empower every Telugu medium student to become a solid programmer and achieve their dreams.</p>
